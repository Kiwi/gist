This wants to be a reliable command-line client for gist.github.com,
because all the others failed somehow, but isn't yet.

It pastes a single file or standard input to gist.github.com as a public gist. 
It does not support authentication and does not depend on the github package (yet).

2020: outdated and obsolete, use `gh gist` instead.
